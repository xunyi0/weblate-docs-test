"There are several ways to handle a gun's bullets in video games. In this "

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/fps_tutorial/part_two.rst:356

"One of the two ways is using a bullet object. This will be an object that "
"travels through the world and handles its own collision code. In this method "
"we create/spawn a bullet object in the direction our gun is facing, and then "
"it travels forward."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/fps_tutorial/part_two.rst:360
msgid ""
"There are several advantages to this method. The first being we do not have "
"to store the bullets in our player. We can simply create the bullet and then "
"move on, and the bullet itself will handle checking for collisions, sending "
"the proper signal(s) to the object it collides with, and destroying itself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/fps_tutorial/part_two.rst:363
msgid ""
"Another advantage is we can have more complex bullet movement. If we want to "
"make the bullet fall ever so slightly as time goes on, we can make the "
"bullet controlling script slowly push the bullet towards the ground. Using "
"an object also makes the bullet take time to reach its target, it doesn't "
"instantly hit whatever it's pointed at. This feels more realistic because "
"nothing in real life moves instantly from one point to another."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/fps_tutorial/part_two.rst:367
msgid ""
"One of the huge disadvantages is performance. While having each bullet "
"calculate their own paths and handle their own collision allows for a lot of "
"flexibility, it comes at the cost of performance. With this method we are "
"calculating every bullet's movement every step, and while this may not be a "
"problem for a few dozen bullets, it can become a huge problem when you "
"potentially have several hundred bullets."

"Despite the performance hit, many first person shooters include some form of "

"GPUs are able to render graphics much faster than CPUs for a few reasons, "

"parallel. A CPU typically has 4 or 8 cores while a GPU typically has "
"thousands. That means a GPU can do hundreds of tasks at once. GPU architects "
"have exploited this in a way that allows for doing many calculations very "
"quickly, but only when many or all cores are doing the same calculation at "
"once, but with different data."

"That is where shaders come in. The GPU will call the shader a bunch of times "
"simultaneously, and then operate on different bits of data (vertices, or "
"pixels). These bunches of data are often called wavefronts. A shader will "
"run the same for every thread in the wavefront. For example, if a given GPU "
"can handle 100 threads per wavefront, a wavefront will run on a 10×10 block "
"of pixels together. It will continue to run for all pixels in that wavefront "
"until they are complete. Accordingly, if you have one pixel slower than the "
